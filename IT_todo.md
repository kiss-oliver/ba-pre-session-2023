# How to prepare for the IT part of the course

## GitHub

Register to github. Remember your username/password, you will need it frequently throughout the classes.

## Git

Depending on your OS, you need to install git/git bash. Please follow the steps corresponding to your OS below:

### Linux distributions
- Your OS might have git pre-installed. Open up a terminal and type:
```
git --version
```
If you get something like
```
git version 2.30.2
```
you are good to go.
- If you get `Command 'git' not found` or anything similar, you need to install git. If you’re on Fedora (or any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:
```
sudo dnf install git
```
- If you’re on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, use apt:
```
sudo apt install git
```
- In other cases follow the guidlines here: <https://git-scm.com/download/linux>

### Mac

- Follow the instructions for Homebrew installation here: <https://git-scm.com/download/mac>. Then open up a terminal and type:
```
git --version
```
If you get something like
```
git version 2.30.2
```
you are good to go.

### Windows

- Download git from here: <https://gitforwindows.org/> then install it. 

# Python

Download and install Anaconda with Python 3.11 on your computer from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads). Please use this distribution even if you have a different version pre-installed on your laptop. We want to ensure that each student has access to the same computing environment with the same Python libraries.
